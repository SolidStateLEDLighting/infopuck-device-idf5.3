# This partition table has been used in a much larger project that included
# AWS IOT Core services and the ability to OTA.  Future examples will require
# this more advanced partition table.

# Note: We allow the system to calculate the memory Offsets.

# Name,     Type,   SubType,    Offset,   Size,      Flags
nvs,        data,   nvs,              ,   0x006000,
nvs_key,    data,   nvs_keys,         ,   0x001000,  encrypted
phy_init,   data,   phy,              ,   0x001000,  encrypted
otadata,    data,   ota,              ,   0x002000,
factory,    app,    factory,          ,   0x2EE000,
ota_0,      app,    ota_0,            ,   0x63E000,
ota_1,      app,    ota_1,            ,   0x63E000,
#
# factory partition  is set to  3.0Mb (never changes)
# ota app partitions are set to 6.5Mb
#
# FYI - Encryption information is supplied here for instruction, but none of it is active until you actually invoke encryption.
#
# NOTE: nvs partition cannot be encrypted - but data is still stored in encrypted form. (requires Flash encryption)
# NOTE: app partitions are always treated as encrypted when encryption enabled at a system level (no need to flag it)
# NOTE: Encryption requires boot offset from partition table to be set at 0xC000 (this is set in menuConfig)
# NOTE: Subtype nvs_keys must be of type data with a minumum size of 0x1000 and marked encrypted.
